# Fisher's Iris data set


## About 
The Iris flower data set was first introduced by the British statistician Ronald Fisher in 1936 as an example of linear discriminant analysis (Fisher 1936). It has since become a classical example of a multivariate dataset which involves the observation and analysis of more than one statistical outcome variable at a time (Field, Miles and Field 2013). Its popularity as a dataset is possibly best exemplified by a simple google scholar search of the term “iris dataset” which returns over 7000 publications. The data set consists of fifty samples from each of three species of Iris (Fig 1). For each sample, four features were measured, namely: the length and the width of both the sepals and petals.
